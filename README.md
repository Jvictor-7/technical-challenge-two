# Technical Challenge Two

> In this project I tried to develop an application for reading eBooks that offers an interactive and easy-to-use experience for users.

## ‚ú® Features achieved

- [x] 1. Download List of Books and Covers
   - The application must access an API to download an updated list of books and their respective covers
- [x] 2. Bookshelf
   - Display the covers of downloaded books in an organized way on a virtual shelf
- [x] 3. Downloading and Storing Books:
   - Allow the user to download a book by tapping its cover and saving the file to the device
- [ ] 4. Book Exhibition:
   - Use the plugin [Vocsy Epub Viewer](https://pub.dev/packages/vocsy_epub_viewer) to display the content of the book.
- [ ] 5. Interface Navigation:
   - Include a button so that the user can easily return to the bookshelf while reading.
- [x] 6. Favorites (bonus feature)
   - Create a favorites tab above the app. When you tap Favorites, only your favorite books will be displayed.
   - To favorite a book, on the home shelf, the user taps the bookmark in the top right corner. This information must be persisted when the user returns to the app.
   - In a favorite book, the bookmark appears in red. If you tap on the already activated bookmark, it goes out and the book is removed from the favorites list.
